# Minnow is a collection of resources for learning.

We call our users Minnows because they gather resources together to adapt to new things. All of the content on Minnow is generated by its users. Minnows create subminnows and put resources into them. These subminnows can be created for a class at school or, more generally, for a subject like History or Biology.

This is the front end code for Minnow. It's built with Backbone.js, Sass, and a mixture of other technologies. Feel free to check it out and message me@beninada.com for any questions.
