# Minnow

Minnow is a collection of resources for learning
We call our users Minnows because they gather resources together to adapt to new things. All of the content on Minnow is generated by its users. Minnows create subminnows and put resources into them. These subminnows can be created for a class at school or, more generally, for a subject like History or Biology.
 
The inspiration for Minnow came from a problem. As students, we often struggled to find the resources necessary to learn new things in class â€” after all, sometimes lectures alone just wouldn't cut it.
